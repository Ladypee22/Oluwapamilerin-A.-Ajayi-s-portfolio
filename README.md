## **1. Project Overview**
This project involved a comprehensive analysis of coffee sales data from March 2024 to August 2024, spanning a dataset of 1,396 transactions. The primary objective was to assess sales performance and extract actionable insights that could help understand customer preferences, revenue trends, and product performance.

## **2. Problem Statement**
The coffee shop lacks a data-driven understanding of its sales performance, product profitability, and customer payment preferences over time. Without proper insights, it is challenging to identify which coffee types drive the most revenue, recognize seasonal sales patterns, or determine the effectiveness of current inventory and pricing strategies. This lack of visibility can lead to missed opportunities, inefficient stocking, and suboptimal decision-making.

To address this, a detailed sales performance analysis is needed—covering a 6-month period to uncover key trends, highlight top-performing products, and support strategic planning for sustained business growth.

## **Methodology**
 Understanding the task given (which is listed above) as well as the dataset 
were the first steps taken 

 The dataset was cleaned to ensure there are no duplicate values, blank spaces 
and obviously wrong inputs 

 Analysis was carried out by generating appropriate chart and tables from the 
dataset to help transform the data into an easy-to-understand graphical format. 

 The findings from the analysis were interpreted to tell how the data answers 
the question 

 Finally, insight and conclusion were made based on the analysis

## **Data Design**
The data is in a structured format (Tabular form) but was not clean. The data was cleaned by removing duplicates, filtering the blank spaces and correcting obviously wrong data input. The data was primarily cleaned in Microsoft excel. The tool used in visualizing the data is Microsoft excel while the dashboard was created using Microsoft Power Bi. 

## **Key Insight**

 The first table on the dashboard shows that the highest sales were achieved in 
May ($9,063.42), while the lowest sales were recorded in April ($6,720.56) 

 The second chart, a pie chart, indicates that the majority of customers prefer 
to pay by card (93.62%) rather than by cash (6.38%). 

 The third and fourth charts show that, although Americano with milk is the 
best-selling coffee type, lattes generate the highest income, with Americano 
with milk coming in second. 

 The last chart shows the monthly sales trend from March to August and the 
following was observed; 

     In March, lattes had the highest income, while cocoa and espresso had the 
    lowest. 

     In April, cappuccinos generated the most income, whereas espresso 
    generated the least. 

     Latte sales peaked in May. 

     In June, Americanos with milk brought in the highest income, marking the 
    best sales for this beverage. 
  
     In both July and August, lattes and Americanos with milk generated 
    approximately the same income.
