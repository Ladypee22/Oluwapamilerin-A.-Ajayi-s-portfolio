## **1. Project Overview**
This project involved a comprehensive analysis of coffee sales data from March 2024 to August 2024, spanning a dataset of 1,396 transactions. The primary objective was to assess sales performance and extract actionable insights that could help understand customer preferences, revenue trends, and product performance.
## **2. Problem Statement**
The coffee shop lacks a data-driven understanding of its sales performance, product profitability, and customer payment preferences over time. Without proper insights, it is challenging to identify which coffee types drive the most revenue, recognize seasonal sales patterns, or determine the effectiveness of current inventory and pricing strategies. This lack of visibility can lead to missed opportunities, inefficient stocking, and suboptimal decision-making.

To address this, a detailed sales performance analysis is needed—covering a 6-month period—to uncover key trends, highlight top-performing products, and support strategic planning for sustained business growth.
